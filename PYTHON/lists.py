# tuples are created using parenthesis instead of square brackets

# Sets

# sets are like lists, but they are unordered and unindexed! no duplicates are allowed

# carsBrand = {"ford", "chevy", "dodge", "honda", "toyota"}

# motosBrand = {"honda", "yamaha", "suzuki", "kawasaki"}

# # carsBrand.add("bmw")  # to add an item to the set
# # carsBrand.remove("ford")  # to remove an item from the set
# # carsBrand.clear()  # to clear the set
# # carsBrand.update(motosBrand)  # to add multiple items to the set

# # brands = carsBrand.union(motosBrand)  # to join two sets

# # difference between two sets

# print(carsBrand.difference(motosBrand)) # to return what they donÂ´t have in common
# print(carsBrand.intersection(motosBrand)) # to return what they have in common
